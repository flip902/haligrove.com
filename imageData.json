UK Cheese became popular for its energetic, euphoric head effects combined with its impressive pain relief potential. It quickly spread beyond the borders of its British home. Most users experience alert, sativa effects that allow for mental relaxation without sedation, but it may hasten bedtime for some. Effects tend to be felt in the head first, generally around the eyes, then spread throughout the entire body, producing muscle relaxation and even some tingly numbness.
