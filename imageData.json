This strain is thought to be a specific phenotype (same genetics, different end result) of Skunk #1 that was originally cultivated in the early 1990s by a UK collective group known as “Exodus.” (As a result, this strain is also known as Exodus Cheese.) UK Cheese became popular for its energetic, euphoric head effects combined with its impressive pain relief potential. It quickly spread beyond the borders of its British home. Most users experience alert, sativa effects that allow for mental relaxation without sedation, but it may hasten bedtime for some. Effects tend to be felt in the head first, generally around the eyes, then spread throughout the entire body, producing muscle relaxation and even some tingly numbness. UK’s flowers are on the denser end of the scale and light green with a coat of orange hairs that would make both Prince Charles and Prince William jealous.",
